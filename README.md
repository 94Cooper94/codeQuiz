The 'home' page will include a start button with a brief description of the quiz. Upon starting the quiz, the timer will begin.

After answering a question, the div that contains the questions will alert the test-taker whether they've answered correctly or incorrect. The score in the top corner will track the user's total score. Above is an example of the test-taker answering the question correctly. Below is an example of a user answering incorrectly. The total score ultimately is equal to zero as the user answered correctly and then incorrectly. This score is also tracked in the user's local storage.

The highscore/final page is a work in progress. Answering incorrectly causing the timer to be reduced is also a work in progress. Otherwise, enjoy what you see! I'll be refinishing this quiz overtime as my skillset grows broader.

Thank you for stopping by.
